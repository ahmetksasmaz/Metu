  For testwriteExpression function:

  P.S. Input is in (AST, Mapping) form and Output is in "String" form.
  
  For testevaluateAST function:
  1. Add an element to the end of testevaluateAST function call's parameter as (Input,Output)
  P.S. Input is in (AST, Mapping) form and Output is in (AST, String) form.
  
  In "test" function, your sample will be the last numbered sample.
